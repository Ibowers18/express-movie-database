# express-movie-database
The purpose of the project is to create a Movie related database using APIs and the RESTful design pattern using Node.js Express middleware.
An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of rules that define how a software component can interact with another software component. In the context of a web service those interactions relate to the manipulation and retrieval of data in accordance with the four basic functions of persistent storage: create, read, update, and delete (CRUD). The style in which these rules are defined is referred to as the “REST architectural style”.
REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It provides a way to represent resources (i.e. data) and transfer it over HTTP by calling a URI/URL. The URI represents the data as a noun and the data function (CRUD) is represented by an HTTP method. Typically the HTTP methods maps to CRUD functionality as should in the following table.

CRUD functionality	HTTP method:
POST 	Create
GET 	Read
PUT / PATCH 	Update / Partial update
DELETE 	Delete
